* Make nvidia cuda work for blender in arch-based distros

I have only tried this for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770.

** Install cuda-tools dependencies
When trying to render any scene using GPU compute and cuda, this error pops up: "nvcc fatal : Value 'sm_30' is not defined for option 'gpu-architecture'". I solved it in this way. (Thanks to [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=259714][these people]])

It is important not to install directly the cuda-tools package from the repositories due to the fact that it is going to install the latest version of cuda. Install the following packages (dependencies in [[https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/cuda-tools/][arch repos]]):

#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk nss gdb
#+end_src

As far as I know, this installs the compiler for cuda, now, the following command will download the cuda version compatible for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 graphics card.

#+begin_src bash
yay -S cuda-10.2
#+end_src

If we try now to enable cuda toolkit in blender and go to render view, it will through the following error "nvcc fatal : Path to libdevice library not specified".

To solve it, add the following to the ~/.profile file ([[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1254849/nvcc-fatal-path-to-libdevice-library-not-specified][source]]):

#+begin_src bash
export PATH="/opt/cuda-10.2/nsight-compute-2019.5.0:$PATH"
export PATH="/opt/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH"
export CUDA_HOME="/opt/cuda-10.2"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/cuda-10.2/lib64":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#+end_src

The above information relative to the cuda directory can be found running the following command:

#+begin_src bash
whereis nvvc
#+end_src
