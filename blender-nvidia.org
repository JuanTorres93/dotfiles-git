* Make nvidia cuda work for blender in arch-based distros

I have only tried this for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770.

** Install cuda-tools dependencies
It is important not to install directly the cuda-tools package from the repositories due to the fact that it is going to install the latest version of cuda. Install the following packages (dependencies in [[https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/cuda-tools/][arch repos]]):

#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk nss gdb
#+end_src

As far as I know, this installs the compiler for cuda, now, the following command will download the cuda version compatible for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 graphics card.

#+begin_src bash
yay -S cuda-10.2
#+end_src

If we try now to enable cuda toolkit in blender and go to render view, it will through the following error "nvcc fatal : Path to libdevice library not specified".

To solve it, add the following to the ~/.profile file:

#+begin_src bash
export PATH="/opt/cuda-10.2/nsight-compute-2019.5.0:$PATH"
export PATH="/opt/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH"
export CUDA_HOME="/opt/cuda-10.2"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/cuda-10.2/lib64":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#+end_src
